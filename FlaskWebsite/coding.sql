Everything around us is tech driven and it is a boon for us if it is utilized properly, otherwise it can be a bane too.\r\nWho would have thought that all the present technologies could be possible a few years back ?\r\n                   It makes our life much easier in every aspect and works efficiently and accurately if utilized properly. Even in a pandemic situation like covid-19, it is only through technology that many people are able to learn even from home and work online for jobs. However Technology has some negative impacts too.\r\n\r\n                                                                    Impacts of Technology\r\nAs a matter of fact, Technology is everywhere it even has some negative impacts which can directly effect our health. Some of the negative impacts are- \r\nExcessive use of gadgets like computers, laptops, mobile phones, tablets etc., can lead to a severe eye strain. Most of the teenagers and youth face this problem.\r\nMany people have the habit of using electronic gadgets before sleep but they are not aware of seriously this can effect their sleep. The light which gets emitted from the devices will have a serious impact on the brain cells.\r\nDue to lack of sleep this can even lead to emotional sickness.\r\nSome people totally get addicted to these gadgets by playing games (mostly children and teenagers) which also has an negative effect in their behavior. \r\nThere will be a lot of health problems like obesity, mental problems, violence, sleeping problems etc.,\r\nSome of the positive impacts are-\r\nThe main positive impact is the communication between the people. Even though the people are anywhere in the world they can easily contact one another through various technologies.\r\nIt is only through technology that many people are able to learn from home and are able to work online from home for their jobs.\r\nThere are many health checking devices that helps us to do a checkup even in our homes. We can even buy anything easily from our homes itself.\r\nIt also provides a lot of entertainment through Tv\'s, mobile phones etc.,\r\nIn a simple way, through technology life becomes more easier. We have even placed our legs on the other planets and even built robots which will perform the works for us while we can rest happily.      \r\n      As mentioned earlier, Technology has become a part of our lives. By using Technology in a right way we can reduce all it\'s negative impacts and can enjoy all the positive impacts of it.', 'technology.jpg', '2021-09-19 17:37:23'),

(7, 'What is technology evolving', 'seventh_post', 'What is technology? \r\n\r\nBasically the collection of techniques, skills, methods and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation is called as Technology. It can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, etc. or it can be embedded in machines, computers, devices and factories, which can be operated by individuals without detailed knowledge of the workings of such things.\r\n\r\nThe human species\' use of technology began with the conversion of natural resources into simple tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale. The steady progress of military technology has brought weapons of ever-increasing destructive power, from clubs to nuclear weapons.\r\nWhat is technology evolving\r\n\r\nThe constant evolution of technology, as well as the arrival of a plethora (a large amount) of new apps and tools, has made recruitment technologies an exceptionally interesting market. So, it is understandable that recruitment technologies have come a long way. And among the many such technologies currently in the market, mobile apps are perhaps the most popular. And this is largely due to the fact that a current lot of millennial candidates are more inclined to use mobile devices for almost everything, including looking for jobs.\r\nWith that being said, we acknowledge that it is extremely easy to get caught up in the bells and whistles of the latest innovations in the way of adopting the latest recruitment technology. So, remember that even though new technologies might seem very attractive, they only attain any value in the larger context when they successfully enable recruiters to better understand their clients\' requirements as well as the candidate pool.', 'tech.jpg', '2021-09-19 10:54:19');
